# Download_video_through_m3u8
Download ts files through the (given) m3u8 file and merge them into a mp4 file with ffmpeg

To use it, you may install ffmpeg for Windows at first. Before running, you may change the path of Desktop in code to yours, and put the m3u8 file at Desktop.

Maybe will work on downloading the ts files with the original video link
